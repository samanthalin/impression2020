			<h2 class="cat-name">One Place called Jiang-Hu</h2>
			<p class="cat-intro">
				Jiang-Hu, a word that has multiple extensions in Chinese culture. It is a metaphor for the martial arts world of ancient China. Jiang-Hu often appear in martial arts films or Kung-Fu films, which feature numerous fights between martial artists. Over decades, Jiang-Hu became a term for a sub-society that assimilated bandits, outlaws and gangs who lived "outside the existing law".
			</p>
			<p class="cat-intro">
				With this unique film genre, Vengeance of the <span>Phoenix Sisters</span> (1968) and The Gangs, the Oscars, and the <span>Walking Dead</span> (2019) are selected to present Taiwanese martial arts films in 1960s and contemporary. Both features show completely different perspectives of the Jiang-Hu concept and its diversity in the Taiwanese cinema.

			<h2 class="cat-name">Black movies, black history</h2>
			<p class="cat-intro">
				In late 1970s to early 1980s, shortly only 5 years, there’s spectacular phenomena of production of R rated movies in Taiwanese cinema. Those sensational, dramatic B Movies are so called social realistic which in fact are the exact opposite of the realty under the martial law period. So how could those films with sex and violence scenes have passed the censorship and were released in the time of conservative ideology. Those black movies reveal the unspeakable history of Taiwan and its mysterious historical background.

						<div class="intro">
							<p>This incisive documentary brings back to life a Taiwanese film genre that was given up for dead. In the early 1980s, a time of strict censorship and political repression in Taiwan, an unexpected trend in “social realist” crime films suddenly flourished in the corner of exploitation cinema. However, the “social realism” here is a euphemistic description for what is really a B-film genre, which exploited both sex and violence.</p>
							<p>Given momentum by sensational dramas featuring female avengers, these films marked an interesting counterpoint to the rise of Taiwan New Cinema, the definitive new wave movement in Taiwan’s film history. This documentary comprises fragments from many of these now untraceable films, alongside interviews with the filmmakers who were involved.</p>

							<p>In Shanghai, Hai-Nan, son of a Chinese official, is found stabbed on the street. But when the culprit, Li-Fang, is apprehended, she refuses to reveal her motives. Meanwhile, a police officer grows suspicious of the officials’ rush to close the case. As he searches for leads in the case files, a shocking truth about Li-Fang is revealed.</p>
							<p>Adapted from the “scar literature” of Mainland China, this anti-communist film uses a woman’s drastic change in personality after she is raped by Chinese officials and his son as an allusion to the Mainland’s political corruption. Taiwan was still under martial law at the time the film was made, so setting a story in Shanghai allowed the makers to circumvent Taiwan’s strict censorship laws on sex and violence. It is also worth noting that at that time, the distributors marketed the film around the female lead LU Hsiao-Fen’s sexy image, which was far removed from the film’s essence of social realism and its political message.</p>

							<p>TAIPEILOVE* is a documentary on the perception of homosexuality in Taiwanese society and its fight for same-sex marriage. In May 2019 Taiwan legalized the same-sex marriage and became the only country in Asia where same-sex marriage is legal. So how Taiwan achieved that through years. The film deals with the questions: How free, safe and happy can gays and lesbians live in Taiwanese society? How do their families and friends react? What role do religion, societal and cultural expectations play?</p>
